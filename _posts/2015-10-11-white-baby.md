Tonight, Alex will appear in a staged reading of new Swedish play, **White Baby**, by Sofia Freden. A satirical, ironic look at modern relationships, attitudes to race relations, and politics, White Baby sold out within days. Performing at the Drayton Arms Theatre in South Kensington will be a first for Alex-- as will playing a potty-mouthed, hopeful migrant masquerading as a ten year old girl.
