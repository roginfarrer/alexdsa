After a hugely successful month at Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2016, and London transfer to Theatre503, *Octopus* is heading on a UK Tour throughout this Spring/Summer.

Alex will be reprising her role as Sara, a highly responsible (and slightly right-leaning) accountant who is waiting for her citizenship interview with two other women in a post-Brexit Britain.
