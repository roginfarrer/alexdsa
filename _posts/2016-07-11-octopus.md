Alex has been cast in the role of Sara in Afsaneh Gray's new play "Octopus": an anarchic comedy about Britishness, if anybody knows what it is, and the power of punk.

"Octopus" will be at [The Old Red Lion](http://www.oldredliontheatre.co.uk/octopus.html) between 22-24th July, and at the [Assembly Fest Box Space](https://www.assemblyfestival.com/event/341/) at the Edinburgh Fringe festival between 4-28th August. Tickets can be bought by clicking through above!
