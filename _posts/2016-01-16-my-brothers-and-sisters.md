Today, Alex starts a two-week run of "My Brothers & Sisters", a one-act play about radicalisation at Sarah Siddons Theatre, Edgeware Road. 

Written and produced by Mad 'Ed Theatre company, this short play is an insight into a British-Muslim family and the worse 48 hours they are ever likely to experience. Alex will be multi-roling as Naheed and Shamilla Hassan. The show will be played to at least 5,000 people over the course of two weeks.
