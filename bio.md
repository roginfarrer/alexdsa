## Bio

![Alexandra D'Sa]({{ site.baseurl }}/forestryio/images/headshot.jpg){: .alignleft }

Alexandra is a British actress from London, with Portuguese-Indian heritage. Having just acclimatised to living north of the river, she is an East London resident who will never be cool enough to live in East London.

Alex studied Acting at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, graduating in 2015. She has a 1:1 degree in English Literature from the University of Exeter, and also studied performance and Women's Studies at Vassar College, New York. Alex is a comedic and dramatic actress, particularly interested in work which provokes critique of social norms, or makes people laugh so much they need to use the facilities. 

Beyond her theatrical inclinations, Alex enjoys studying critical, feminist, and queer theory; she likes a good sci-fi show, and an even better classic novel.
